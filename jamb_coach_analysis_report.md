# JAMB Coach App Analysis Report: Question Generation Features

## Executive Summary

After conducting a comprehensive investigation of the JAMB Coach application at `https://9j16qde9pffu.space.minimax.io`, I was unable to access the question generation features due to authentication barriers. While the application prominently advertises AI-powered question generation functionality, all access points require working login credentials, and the provided demo accounts are non-functional.

## Investigation Process

### 1. Initial Navigation and Overview
- **URL**: https://9j16qde9pffu.space.minimax.io
- **Application**: JAMB Coach - AI-powered JAMB coaching app
- **Target Feature**: Question generation capabilities using DeepSeek AI

### 2. Landing Page Analysis
The landing page prominently features:
- **Main Headline**: "Ace Your JAMB Exam"
- **Key Features Advertised**:
  - AI-Powered Questions
  - Smart Analytics
  - Comprehensive Practice
  - Mobile Optimized
  - Daily Practice
  - JAMB Score Prediction
  - Offline Support

### 3. Access Attempt Methods

#### Method 1: "Start Practicing Free" Button
- **Result**: Redirected to registration page (`/register`)
- **Outcome**: Requires account creation

#### Method 2: Demo Account Login
**Demo Accounts Listed on Login Page**:
- Student: `student@demo.com` / `password123`
- Admin: `admin@demo.com` / `password123`

**Login Attempts Results**:
- **Student Account**: `AuthApiError: Invalid login credentials`
- **Admin Account**: `AuthApiError: Invalid login credentials`
- **System Response**: HTTP 400 - Invalid credentials for both accounts

#### Method 3: Alternative Access Points
- Explored all interactive elements on the landing page
- Checked footer links and navigation options
- Reviewed complete page content through scrolling
- **Result**: No guest access, demo modes, or sample question features found

## Technical Findings

### Console Error Analysis
```
Error: AuthApiError: Invalid login credentials
Response: HTTP 400 - x-sb-error-code: invalid_credentials
Authentication System: Supabase
```

### Application Architecture
- **Authentication**: Supabase-based auth system
- **Frontend**: Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Backend**: Hosted on `zjfilhbczaquokqlcoej.supabase.co`

## Key Observations

### 1. AI Features Advertised
The application heavily promotes AI-powered functionality:
- "AI-Powered Questions" listed as primary feature
- Student testimonials specifically mention "AI questions" and "detailed explanations"
- Marketing copy emphasizes "personalized questions" powered by AI

### 2. Authentication Barrier
- **Complete Access Control**: All question generation features locked behind authentication
- **No Guest Access**: No trial modes, sample questions, or demo functionality available
- **Demo Accounts Non-Functional**: Provided demo credentials return authentication errors

### 3. Question Generation Features (Advertised but Inaccessible)
Based on marketing materials and testimonials:
- AI-powered question generation
- Personalized question sets
- Detailed explanations
- Subject coverage: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English Language

## Limitations Encountered

### 1. Authentication Barrier
- Cannot verify if DeepSeek AI is generating questions vs. using mock data
- Unable to test question generation functionality
- Cannot access the actual practice interface

### 2. Demo Account Issues
- Listed demo accounts are non-functional
- No alternative guest access methods available
- Authentication system appears to be production-level with no testing backdoors

### 3. Missing Demo Content
- No sample questions visible on public pages
- No preview of AI-generated content
- No publicly accessible question examples

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Access
1. **Contact App Developer**: Request working demo credentials or temporary access
2. **Account Creation**: Create a legitimate account through registration (if email verification allows)
3. **Developer Console**: Check if there are any developer tools or debug modes

### For Future Investigation
1. **API Analysis**: Examine network requests to identify question generation endpoints
2. **Mobile App**: Check if mobile versions have different access patterns
3. **Documentation Review**: Look for API documentation or developer guides

## Conclusions

### Current Status
- **Question Generation Features**: Present but inaccessible
- **DeepSeek AI Integration**: Cannot be verified due to authentication barriers
- **Demo Functionality**: Non-operational despite being advertised

### Evidence of AI Integration
While unable to test directly, multiple indicators suggest legitimate AI integration:
- Consistent messaging about AI-powered questions across all marketing materials
- Specific testimonials mentioning AI question quality
- Professional implementation with modern authentication systems
- Structured subject coverage suggesting systematic content generation

### Next Steps Required
To complete the analysis of whether DeepSeek AI is generating questions instead of mock data, the following would be needed:
1. Working authentication credentials
2. Access to the question generation interface
3. Ability to trigger multiple question generation requests
4. Comparison of generated content patterns

## Technical Screenshots
- Landing page overview: Shows AI-powered features
- Login page with demo accounts: Documents authentication barrier
- Console errors: Confirms demo account authentication failures
