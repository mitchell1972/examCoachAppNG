  - Practice Center "Automated Question Delivery System" section
  - Individual subject cards display "50 questions per set" and "Every 3 days"
  
- **"Nigerian time (6 AM)" references:** ✅ **FOUND** - Clearly mentioned in the Automated Question Delivery System:

### UI Design Quality:

- Clear visual hierarchy and intuitive layout
- Responsive design elements functioning properly

## 3. Core Interface Elements ✅

### Subject Selection Interface:
- **Subject Browsing:** ✅ **PASS** - Clear subject cards with visual icons
- **Available Subjects:** Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English Language
- **Subject Access:** Direct navigation links in sidebar and practice buttons on cards

### Question Set Display:
- **Display Format:** Well-organized subject cards showing:
  - Question count (50 questions per set)
  - Delivery frequency (Every 3 days)
  - Status indicators (Total Sets, Accessible, Locked)
  - Clear call-to-action buttons

### Subscription Messaging:
- **Clarity:** ✅ **PASS** - Clear subscription model presentation

  - "First question set for each subject is completely free" messaging

### Interactive Elements:

- **Practice Buttons:** Individual practice buttons for each subject
- **Navigation Flow:** Smooth transitions between pages

## 4. Initial Content Verification ⚠️

### Content Accessibility:
- **Question Set Visibility:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Question sets are visible in list format but content appears locked
- **Free vs Premium Indicators:** ✅ **PRESENT** - Clear distinction with:
  - "Subscribe for Access" buttons indicating premium content
  - Status counters showing "0" accessible sets
  - Free first question set mentioned in messaging

### Authentication Considerations:
- **Public Access Testing:** ⚠️ **LIMITED** - Unable to test completely logged-out state
  - Sign-out functionality appears to have session persistence issues
  - Site redirects to dashboard even when accessing /login directly
  - This suggests automatic authentication or session management

## Screenshots Captured

1. **homepage_main.png** - Dashboard with user statistics and subject overview
2. **practice_page.png** - Practice Center with question delivery system details
3. **pricing_page.png** - Subscription plans and premium features
4. **mathematics_subject_page.png** - Subject-specific interface
5. **current_page_state.png** - Pricing page layout and messaging

## Issues Identified

### Minor Issues:
1. **Sign-Out Functionality:** The sign-out button doesn't appear to fully log users out, with persistent session state
2. **Public Access Testing:** Unable to verify completely logged-out user experience due to authentication flow

### Content Discrepancies:
- **Pricing Page Messaging:** Shows "New questions added every 4 days" instead of "every 3 days"
- **Practice Page Messaging:** Correctly shows "every 3 days" messaging

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Sign-Out Flow:** Ensure sign-out button properly clears user sessions
2. **Messaging Consistency:** Align question delivery frequency messaging between pages (3 days vs 4 days)
3. **Public Landing Page:** Consider implementing a true public homepage for non-authenticated users
4. **Free Content Access:** Clarify and test the "first question set is free" functionality

## Overall Assessment

**Grade: A-** (90/100)

The JAMB Coach application demonstrates excellent UI design, clear messaging, and functional core features.
