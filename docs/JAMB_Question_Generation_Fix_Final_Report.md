## Issues Identified & Resolved

### 1. Access Control Bug (Critical)
**Problem:** Students seeing "0 Accessible Sets" despite free question sets being available  
**Root Cause:** Frontend logic using faulty "first set" detection instead of `is_free` flag  
**Solution:** Updated `getAvailableQuestionSets()` function to properly handle free question sets  
**Verification:** Console logs confirm "Granted access to free question set" messages  

### 2. Routing System Failure (Critical)
**Problem:** "Start Practice" button redirecting to dashboard instead of launching practice sessions  
**Root Cause:** Incorrect route in `handleStartPractice()` function (`/practice/` vs `/subject/`)  
**Solution:** Fixed navigation route from `/practice/${subject}` to `/subject/${encodeURIComponent(subject)}`  
**Verification:** Students can now successfully start practice sessions for all subjects  

### 3. Question Count Discrepancy (Primary Issue)
**Problem:** Only 6 questions available instead of required 50 questions  
**Root Cause:** Multiple issues in question generation and database structure  
**Solutions Applied:**
- **Mathematics:** Generated 50 unique, high-quality questions using manual curation
- **Other Subjects:** Fixed duplicate question links - all subjects now have 50 unique questions
- **Database Integrity:** Ensured proper linking between question sets and questions

### 4. Question Quality Enhancement
**Problem:** Low-quality, repetitive AI-generated questions  
**Solution:** Implemented enhanced question generation with:  
- Subject-specific topic coverage
- Diverse difficulty levels
- Comprehensive explanations
- JAMB examination standards compliance
