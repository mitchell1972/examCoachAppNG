## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the successful completion of two critical development tasks for the JAMB Coaching Application. The first was a comprehensive overhaul of the user authentication system to resolve critical security and access control issues. The second was a multi-faceted fix for the question generation and delivery system, ensuring content reliability and application functionality. Both systems are now fully operational, tested, and production-ready.

## 2. Authentication System Overhaul

### 2.1. Initial Problem

The application's original authentication system was experiencing significant failures, preventing users from reliably signing up, logging in, and accessing protected content. The core issue stemmed from improperly configured access control, which blocked legitimate student users from viewing practice questions.

### 2.2. Solution Implemented

A complete rebuild of the authentication and authorization layer was performed using Supabase.

- **Authentication:** Implemented Supabase's built-in authentication for secure user registration and login.
- **Authorization:** Leveraged Supabase's Row-Level Security (RLS) to establish granular and secure data access policies.
- **RLS Policy Fix:** A specific RLS policy on the `questions` table was identified as the root cause of the access issue. This policy was rewritten and deployed to grant authenticated students the correct read permissions for practice questions.

### 2.3. Verification & Testing

A final, end-to-end verification test was conducted, confirming:
- **Successful Login:** Students can sign in without issue.
- **Content Access:** Authenticated students can now successfully access and view practice questions.
- **System Integrity:** The entire authentication flow is stable and functions as expected.

**Conclusion:** The authentication system is now secure, robust, and fully functional.

## 3. Question Generation & Delivery System Fix

### 3.1. Initial Problem

A critical bug was identified where the application was failing to provide the required 50 unique practice questions for each subject. Initial reports showed subjects with as few as 1, 6, or 19 questions, severely impacting the application's core feature.

### 3.2. Investigation and Multi-Phased Resolution

The investigation revealed two distinct underlying issues that were resolved in phases.

#### Phase 1: Fixing Data Integrity

- **Discovery:** The primary issue was not a failure of the question generation API call. Instead, it was a data integrity problem within the application's database. For affected subjects, the system had created 50 entries in the `question_links` table, but all of them pointed to the *same single question record* instead of 50 unique ones.
- **Solution:** The backend Supabase Edge Functions for each subject (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, English, Biology) were invoked to purge the corrupted data and generate a fresh, complete set of 50 unique questions and their corresponding links.

#### Phase 2: Fixing Application Routing

- **Discovery:** After resolving the data issue, testing revealed a UI bug that prevented users from navigating to the practice session. The "Start Practice" button in the `PracticeMode.tsx` component was configured with an incorrect navigation path (`/practice/:subject`).
- **Solution:** The routing logic within the `PracticeMode.tsx` component was corrected to use the proper path (`/subject/:subject`), which aligns with the application's routing structure defined in `App.tsx`. The application was then rebuilt and redeployed with this fix.

### 3.3. Verification & Testing

A full testing cycle was performed on the deployed application, confirming:
- **Correct Question Count:** All five subjects now correctly display and provide access to exactly 50 unique questions.
- **Functional Navigation:** The routing bug is resolved, and users can seamlessly start practice sessions for any subject.
- **System Reliability:** The question generation and delivery system is now reliable and functions as designed.

**Conclusion:** The question generation bug and the associated routing issue have been fully resolved. The application now delivers the correct quantity and quality of content to users.
