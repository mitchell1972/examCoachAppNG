## Technical Issues Identified

### Backend API Errors (Critical)
**Console Log Analysis reveals:**

1. **Profile Fetching Error (HTTP 500)**
   - Error: `Error fetching profile: [object Object]`
   - API Call: `/rest/v1/profiles?select=id,user_id,email,full_name,role`
   - Status: 500 Internal Server Error
   - **Impact:** Role data not loading correctly

2. **Daily Questions Error (HTTP 500)**
   - Error: `Error fetching daily questions: [object Object]`
   - API Call: `/rest/v1/daily_questions`
   - Status: 500 Internal Server Error
   - **Impact:** Dashboard functionality impaired

### Root Cause Analysis
The HTTP 500 errors when fetching profile data explain why the admin role is not being applied correctly. The demo admin login appears to authenticate successfully, but the profile role assignment fails due to server-side issues.

## Conclusion
While the demo admin login process is **fast and functional from a UX perspective**, there are **critical backend issues** preventing proper admin role assignment and feature access. The application currently treats demo admin users as students, rendering the admin demo functionality ineffective.

**Severity Level:** **HIGH** - Core admin functionality is non-functional
**Business Impact:** Demo admin feature cannot be used for demonstrations or testing admin capabilities

**Recommended Action:** Address backend API errors and role assignment issues before promoting this feature to users.
