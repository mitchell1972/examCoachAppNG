ALTER TABLE practice_sessions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_answers DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE notifications DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_activity DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_achievements DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- This is a temporary fix to get the authentication system working
-- In production, proper RLS policies should be implemented;
