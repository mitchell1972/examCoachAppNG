# GitHub Pages Status Report: examCoachAppNG Repository

**Repository:** mitchell1972/examCoachAppNG  
**Investigation Date:** 2025-08-22  
**Repository URL:** https://github.com/mitchell1972/examCoachAppNG

## Executive Summary

**GitHub Pages Status: NOT ENABLED/DEPLOYED**

The examCoachAppNG repository does not currently have GitHub Pages enabled or deployed. Despite containing web application files that would be suitable for GitHub Pages deployment, no GitHub Pages site is currently live.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Repository Structure Analysis

The repository contains files typical of a modern web application:
- `index.html` - Main entry point (suitable for GitHub Pages)
- `package.json` - Node.js project configuration
- `src/` directory - Source code
- `public/` directory - Public assets
- React/TypeScript application components

**Assessment:** The repository structure is well-suited for GitHub Pages deployment as it contains an `index.html` file and appears to be a single-page application.

### 2. GitHub Actions Investigation

**Findings from Actions Tab:**
- No workflows are currently configured
- No deployment automation is set up
- The Actions tab shows only the default GitHub Actions introduction page
- No CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment to GitHub Pages

**Assessment:** No automated deployment process is in place.

### 3. GitHub Pages Deployment Status

**Direct URL Test Results:**
- Attempted to access: `https://mitchell1972.github.io/examCoachAppNG`
- **Result:** 404 Not Found error
- **Error Message:** "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"

**Assessment:** Conclusively confirms that GitHub Pages is not deployed for this repository.

### 4. Settings Access Limitation

**Observation:** The Settings tab was not accessible during this investigation, which is expected behavior for non-collaborators of the repository. Only repository owners and users with admin permissions can access repository settings, including GitHub Pages configuration.

## Recommendations

### For Repository Owner (mitchell1972):

1. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Navigate to repository Settings â†’ Pages
   - Select source branch (typically `main` or `gh-pages`)
   - Choose deployment method (GitHub Actions or Deploy from a branch)

2. **Consider Automated Deployment:**
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
   - Configure build process for the React/TypeScript application
   - Implement automated testing before deployment

3. **Build Process Setup:**
   - The repository appears to be a React/TypeScript application
   - Will likely need a build step to compile/bundle the application
   - Consider using `npm run build` or similar command to generate deployable assets

## Technical Details

- **Repository Type:** React/TypeScript web application
- **Primary Files:** index.html, package.json, src/, public/
- **Deployment Readiness:** High (contains necessary files for web deployment)
- **Current Status:** GitHub Pages not configured
- **Potential Issues:** May require build process configuration

## Evidence

Investigation included:
1. Repository structure examination
2. GitHub Actions workflow analysis
3. Direct GitHub Pages URL verification
4. Visual documentation via screenshots

**Conclusion:** The examCoachAppNG repository is technically ready for GitHub Pages deployment but requires manual configuration by the repository owner to enable the service.
