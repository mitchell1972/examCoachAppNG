## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### ðŸ”´ Priority 1: Student Practice Session Failure
- **Issue:** HTTP 403 Forbidden error prevents students from accessing practice questions
- **Technical Details:** Supabase RLS policies blocking student access to questions table
- **Impact:** Complete failure of core application functionality for students
- **Recommended Fix:** Review and update Supabase Row Level Security policies to allow authenticated students to access practice questions
- **Urgency:** **CRITICAL** - Application is unusable for primary user base (students)

### Error Reproduction Steps:
1. Log in as student user
2. Navigate to Practice Center
3. Select any subject (e.g., Mathematics)
4. Click "View Question Sets"
5. Attempt to "Start Practice" on any question set
6. **Result:** Redirected to dashboard instead of practice interface
7. **Console:** Shows 403 Forbidden error from Supabase API

   - Test question fetching and session creation
   - Validate permission grants for free question sets

3. **End-to-End Testing:**
   - Complete full student practice flow testing
   - Verify question answering and progress tracking
   - Test all subject areas for consistency

### Future Enhancements
