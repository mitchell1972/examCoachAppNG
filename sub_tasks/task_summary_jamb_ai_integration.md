# jamb_ai_integration

Successfully integrated Gemini AI into the JAMB Coaching PWA, enabling automated question generation and smart tutoring features. The system now:

## Key Achievements:
- **✅ AI Integration Complete**: Securely integrated user's Gemini API key into Supabase Edge Functions
- **✅ Live Question Generation**: Successfully tested AI-powered question generation for JAMB curriculum
- **✅ Automated System**: Set up cron job to generate fresh questions every 3 days
- **✅ Cost-Effective Design**: Batch generation approach minimizes API costs while serving unlimited users
- **✅ JAMB-Standard Content**: AI prompts specifically designed for Nigerian curriculum

## Technical Implementation:
- **Secure API Storage**: Gemini API key stored as environment variable in Supabase
- **Edge Functions Deployed**: All AI functions (generate-questions, daily-question-rotation, analyze-performance) are live
- **Database Integration**: AI-generated questions automatically saved to database with proper metadata
- **Automated Scheduling**: Cron job (#1) runs every 3 days at midnight for question refresh
- **Fallback System**: Graceful degradation to mock questions if AI fails

## Final Deliverable:
The PWA at https://rdq6ayo2x80p.space.minimax.io is now a fully functional, AI-powered JAMB exam coaching app serving 5 subjects (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English Language) with automated question generation, progress tracking, and offline capabilities. The system is ready to serve thousands of Nigerian students with fresh, curriculum-aligned content.
