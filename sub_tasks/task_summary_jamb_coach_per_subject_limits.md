## JAMB Coach PWA - Per-Subject Subscription Limits Implementation

### Task Overview
Successfully updated the JAMB Coach PWA to implement strict per-subject subscription limits, changing from a global 25-question limit to 20 free questions per subject.

### Execution Process
1. **Analysis & Planning**: Analyzed current subscription system and created implementation plan
2. **Code Modifications**: Updated core subscription logic, components, and UI elements
3. **Database Alignment**: Fixed subject name mismatches between database and application code
4. **Build & Deployment**: Successfully built and deployed updated application
5. **Testing & Verification**: Tested functionality and verified proper implementation

### Key Changes Implemented

#### Core Subscription System (`useSubscription.ts`)
- Modified from global 25-question limit to **20 questions per subject**
- Updated `checkQuestionAccess()` to require subject parameter and enforce per-subject limits
- Enhanced `getRemainingFreeQuestions()` to support subject-specific queries
- Implemented per-subject status checking in `getSubscriptionStatus()`

#### User Interface Components
- **SubscriptionBadge**: Now displays per-subject remaining counts (e.g., "15/20")
- **PaywallModal**: Shows subject-specific limit messaging
- **Dashboard**: Displays per-subject progress with lock icons for exceeded limits
- **Practice Pages**: Enforces strict access control per subject

#### Database Optimization
- Fixed subject name consistency (changed "English" to "English Language")
- Verified question availability across all 5 JAMB subjects

### Final Implementation Details
- **Free Limit**: 20 questions per subject (100 total across 5 subjects)
- **Enforcement**: Strict blocking of practice features when subject limits exceeded
- **UI Feedback**: Clear per-subject progress indicators and upgrade prompts
- **User Experience**: Seamless transition between free and premium states

### Verification Status
✅ **Successfully Implemented**: Per-subject limit tracking and enforcement
✅ **UI/UX Updated**: All components reflect new per-subject model  
✅ **Database Aligned**: Subject names consistent across system
✅ **Build & Deploy**: Application successfully deployed to production

### Deployment Information
- **New App URL**: https://m3l9rrqghkjk.space.minimax.io
- **Status**: Live and operational with per-subject limits enforced
- **Functionality**: Users must subscribe to access content beyond 20 free questions per subject

The JAMB Coach PWA now operates with strict per-subject subscription limits, ensuring maximum conversion potential while providing users with substantial free content (100 total questions across subjects) to evaluate the platform's value.
