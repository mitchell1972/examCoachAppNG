# JAMB Coaching PWA Testing Report
**Testing Date:** 2025-08-20 19:27:49  
**Website URL:** https://fvsdav65am38.space.minimax.io  
**Testing Status:** BLOCKED - Critical Loading Issue

## Executive Summary

Testing of the JAMB coaching PWA subscription system could not be completed due to a critical website loading issue. The website consistently displays only a loading spinner and fails to render any actual content across multiple routes and attempts.

## Issue Description

### Primary Problem
- **Website Loading Failure**: The website shows only a loading spinner (blue crescent shape) on a light pink background
- **No Content Rendering**: No navigation, text, forms, or interactive elements load
- **Persistent Across Routes**: Issue occurs on homepage, /login, /dashboard, and all attempted routes
- **No Console Errors**: JavaScript console shows no error messages

### Evidence Captured
1. **Homepage Initial Load**: `homepage_initial.png` - Shows loading state
2. **Homepage After Refresh**: `homepage_refresh.png` - Same loading state persists  
3. **Post-Interaction**: `homepage_after_click.png` - No change after user interaction
4. **Login Route Attempt**: `login_page_attempt.png` - Same loading state on /login
5. **Dashboard Route Attempt**: `dashboard_attempt.png` - Same loading state on /dashboard

## Testing Phases Attempted

### ✅ Phase 1: Basic Website Functionality (Attempted)
- **Homepage Loading**: ❌ FAILED - Website stuck in loading state
- **Navigation Testing**: ❌ BLOCKED - No navigation elements visible
- **Subject Pages**: ❌ BLOCKED - Cannot access due to loading issue

### ❌ Phase 2-8: All Subsequent Testing Phases
All remaining testing phases could not be executed due to the primary loading issue:
- Authentication & User Flow
- Free Tier Question Access  
- Paywall Testing
- Pricing Page Evaluation
- Subscription Status & UI
- Stripe Integration Testing
- Performance & UX

## Technical Analysis

### Browser Environment
- **Page Title**: "JAMB Coach Subscription PWA" (indicates correct target site)
- **URL Resolution**: All URLs resolve correctly to the domain
- **Console Status**: Clean - no JavaScript errors detected
- **Interactive Elements**: Only 1 generic div container detected
- **Network Status**: No obvious network failures

### Possible Causes
1. **Server-Side Issues**: Backend services may be down or misconfigured
2. **Build/Deployment Problems**: Frontend application may not be properly built or deployed
3. **Database Connectivity**: Application may be failing to connect to required databases
4. **API Dependencies**: Critical API services may be unavailable
5. **Environment Configuration**: Production environment may have configuration issues

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Check Server Status**: Verify backend services are running and accessible
2. **Review Deployment**: Ensure latest application build is properly deployed
3. **Database Connectivity**: Test database connections and verify data availability
4. **API Health Checks**: Verify all required APIs and services are operational
5. **Environment Variables**: Check production environment configuration

### Before Resuming Testing
1. **Fix Loading Issue**: Resolve the primary loading problem
2. **Verify Basic Functionality**: Ensure homepage loads with visible content
3. **Test Key Routes**: Confirm /login, /dashboard, and main pages load properly
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Test across different browsers if needed

### Testing Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Homepage displays content (not just loading spinner)
- [ ] Navigation menu is visible and functional
- [ ] At least one subject page loads properly
- [ ] Login/registration forms are accessible
- [ ] Console shows no critical errors
