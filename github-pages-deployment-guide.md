# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## Overview
Your JAMB Coach application has been configured for GitHub Pages deployment with automatic GitHub Actions workflow. This will eliminate the "Created by MiniMax Agent" branding that appears on the minimax.io platform.

## What's Been Configured

### 1. Application Updates
- **Router**: Switched from BrowserRouter to HashRouter for better GitHub Pages compatibility
- **Vite Config**: Updated with correct base path (`/examCoachAppNG/`) for GitHub Pages
- **404 Handling**: Added `public/404.html` for proper SPA routing on GitHub Pages
- **Index.html**: Added GitHub Pages routing script for seamless navigation

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow
Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that will:
- Automatically build your application when you push to main/master branch
- Deploy the built files to GitHub Pages
- Handle all the deployment process automatically

## Manual Steps Required

Since the automated push requires GitHub authentication, please complete these steps manually:

### Step 1: Push the Changes to GitHub

1. Open terminal in your project directory
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/jamb-coaching-app

# Check the current status
git status

# The changes are already committed, you just need to push
git push -u origin master
```

3. When prompted, enter your GitHub credentials or personal access token

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/mitchell1972/examCoachAppNG
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Save the changes

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. After pushing the code, GitHub Actions will automatically start building and deploying
2. You can monitor the progress in the **Actions** tab of your repository
3. Once completed, your app will be available at: **https://mitchell1972.github.io/examCoachAppNG/**

## Files Modified

- `vite.config.ts` - Added base path configuration for GitHub Pages
- `src/App.tsx` - Changed to HashRouter for static hosting compatibility  
- `index.html` - Added GitHub Pages routing script
- `public/404.html` - Added for SPA routing support
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment

## Expected Timeline

- **Push to GitHub**: Immediate
- **First deployment**: 5-10 minutes after push
- **Subsequent deployments**: Automatic on every push to master branch

## Benefits

✅ **No Branding**: Your app will be free of any platform branding  
✅ **Automatic Deployment**: Every code update automatically deploys  
✅ **Custom Domain Ready**: Can later add your own domain if needed  
✅ **Fast Loading**: GitHub Pages provides excellent performance  
✅ **Free Hosting**: No cost for public repositories  

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Push fails**: Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
2. **Deployment fails**: Check the Actions tab for error logs
3. **App doesn't load**: Verify the base path is correct in vite.config.ts
4. **Routes don't work**: The HashRouter should handle this automatically

## Next Steps

Once you complete the manual push, your application will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages without any branding overlays. All future updates to the master branch will trigger automatic redeployment.
